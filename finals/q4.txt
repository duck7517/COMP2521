Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Kruksal's algorithm was used for this minimum spanning tree. Only Prim's and Kruksal's are used for minimum spanning tree. Prim's takes adjacent edges only while Kruksal's does not require edges to be adjacent such as in this question so it is not Prim's.
