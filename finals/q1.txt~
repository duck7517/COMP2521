Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.
    
    19. 2^10 = 1024 processes. A computer 1000 times faster can process 1024000 
    which is between 2^19 and 2^20. So maximum is 19.



(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.
    Binary search uses less comparisons which decreases the time complexity.
    Quad search decreases the soze of the search space twice as fast but with three times the number of comparisons.


(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.
    
    fnA recurses b-a number of times. the time complexity would be O(n).
    fnB is (b-a)^2. Calls itself the number of times it takes for a to equal b but also calls fnA each time.
