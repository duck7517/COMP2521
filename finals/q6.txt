Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

The heap data structure is the most suitable as it has an advantage in time complexity over the other structures. For the others, the time complexity is O(n) for insertion and deletion. Heap, however takes O(logn).
