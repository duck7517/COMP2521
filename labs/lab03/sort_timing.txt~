As the input size increases, the time taken increased as expected. However there
were significant differences in the time taken for random, sorted and reverse
initial order for each input size. Notably, the reversed inital order takes 
the least amount of time. This can be attributed to the structure of
IntListInsertInOrder function which is used to sort. The function is written to
check for the position of the new item to be inserted. In the reverse order,
the new item is always the smallest one so far. Thus, in the function, the loop
only runs once to find the position of the newest item. It is seen that the
time difference increases as the input size increases. The reversed order will 
only ever run the loop once to find the postion. The sorted will alway have to 
go through the whole queue, and the random is unpredictable.
